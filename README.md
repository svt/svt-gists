This a collection of various (maybe:) useful small scripts and code snippets.
It came to exist when when we realized we wanted to share small utilities and scripts in various languages in the GitHub Gists-style.

Every util is found under a subdirectory, with a corrensponding README, describing it's intended usage and license.

Please add your improvements in a Pull Request.
